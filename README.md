# Deploy & Update Transaction
The deploy.py file is built following the tutorials by Patrick Collins on FreeCodeCamp. I built this to understand what's actually going on behind the scenes of a transaction in the chain. 
You can use this as I have also added my own explainations for each line in the form of comments.
